<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schools of talking about letters seem fundamentally connected to the lexicon used to describe them. The approach of KABK in teaching typography and type design, for being relatively unique, offers a good vantage point to investigate some of the ways in which the language we use affects the shapes we draw. This thesis exists to critically explore the topic of vocabulary and taxonomy within typography and typeface design, their use as teaching and design tools, and suggest the hypothesis; the only way to innovate in the field of typeface design is to innovate on the methods of describing type, and through critical consideration of the categories in which one thinks.</p>

<h2>‘Taxonomy’, ‘Classification’, and such</h2>
<p>A taxonomy is a system of classes in which things can be allocated. In context of typography and typeface design, these exist to organise fonts based on their qualities to make them easier to filter through and to offer a shorthand for describing them.</p>
<p>When I speak of a ‘taxonomy’, I’m referring to many different things that might not self-describe as such. The standard I use for determining what counts and what doesn’t is loose; I call any system of categories a <em>taxonomy</em>, and the placement of specific typefaces in specific categories is a <em>classification</em>. I am also using the terms <em>lexicon</em>, <em>wording</em>, <em>system of classification</em>, <em>categories in which we think</em>, and <em>nomenclature</em> as synonyms for ‘taxonomy’ as applied in different contexts; my interest is not in the academic rigour related to the exact linguistic categories, but rather the linguistics themselves in relation to the visual craft. And, in similar spirit, the field of typeface design does not follow any strict rigour in its categories; the most common way of understanding type is a sort of folk taxonomy, an amalgamation of different categories representing different systems.</p>
<p>Research into typography often encounters wording so ill-defined,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Tracy, W. (2003). Letters of credit: A view of type design (p. 13). Fraser.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> it can seem deliberately adverserial. We describe and talk about fonts by gesturing to a semiotic mess, a web of signifiers and references that technically do work — and sometimes with unreasonable effectiveness — but are inconsistent, sloppy, and conflate distinct ideas needlessly. We refer to the styles of typefaces through words describing periods (e.g. Modern) or locations in which they originated (e.g. Venetian), or sometimes even referencing the names of the originators of the styles (e.g. Didone) and dotted on every level are minor inconsistencies that serve no other purpose than to confuse. Some solutions to the problems of complex wording end up removing crucial nuance — a particularly egregious example is the occasional insistence that we stop distinguishing ‘typeface’ from ‘font’ instead of just adapting a more contemporarily relevant definition for ‘font’.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Because historically the font has been the specific set of metal sorts and a typeface has been the design, one such idea is to simply define a font as a means of reproduction of the typeface, which allows for all the necessary nuance and embodies contemporary uses of ‘font’ as well as ‘typeface’.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span></p>
<p>I would speculate the reasons for the issue are simple. The first and most obvious is that many people are likely not even aware that there is a plurality of taxonomies. They may only know one, and know it as ‘<em>the</em> classification of typefaces’. Or, they may simply be searching rather than sorting typefaces — then, using the words that would most likely describe a typeface is an effective strategy. On the side of typeface designers, the blame probably lies in SEO, but in terms of actual descriptive writing, I wonder if it isn’t because of the assumption that “everything is done by eye”.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Hochuli, J.

<br/>
</span></span> If we think of ourselves as working with raw material — the black and the white of words or letters — and shaping it to our exact visual preference, it’s tempting to think of the lexicon we use to describe it as just decoration for the work that, to us, speaks for itself. Like it’s only there as a descriptive tool for people who haven’t developed their ability to see detail in type, mostly a tool for search and marketing.</p>
<p>But that it isn’t.</p>
<p>The categories we use obviously affect how we think.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-011-0083-5?te=1&amp;nl=in-her+words&amp;emc=edit_gn_20200302">Prewitt-Freilino, J.

<p>Regardless of the reason for not exploring various systems of classification in type, it’s worthwhile to see how various main approaches can impact the corpus of a type designer.</p>
<p>Throughout this thesis I intend to take a critical look at how the categories and words we use condition us to think about typography, and speculate on how they affect the output of typeface designers and typographers.</p>
<p>If my argumentative musings are successful, at the end the reader will appreciate terminology as a valuable tool for understanding typography on different levels, a skill that should be developed and extended much like any other (e.g. the ability to draw, see detail, understand technology, etc.), and a form of conditioning that, if unexamined, can creates bias that one might be unaware of, be it desirable or not.</p>

<section class="level2" id="cases-of-categorical-perception">
<h2>Cases of Categorical Perception</h2>
<p>What is called ‘Vox-AtypI classification’ is hardly one thing. There is the ‘Wikipedia’ edition, that is to say a classification of latin types into 3 umbrella terms, and their subcategories, the first of which is the Classicals, containing Venetian, Garalde, and Transitional types. Following it is Moderns, containing Didones, Mechanistic (or slab-serif), and Linéales (or sans-serif), and the last main category is Calligraphics, containing Glyphic, Script, Graphic, Blackletter, and Gaelic subcategories.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32669.html">Devroye, L. (2025). <em>Vox type classification</em>. Devroye.org. https://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32669.html</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> In the modern day the category of Linéales is rarely alluded to, instead the words for sans-serifs in use come from the British Standard 1967 classification (based on Vox’s classification), which divides them further into more familiar categories; Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://luc.devroye.org/britishstandards.html">Devroye, L. (n.d.). British Standards for Type Classification. Retrieved 30 January 2025, from https://luc.devroye.org/britishstandards.html</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> When I speak of a ‘folk taxonomy’ of typefaces, this is what I’m referring to; most imbued in the contemporary lexicon is a combination of Vox-AtypI and the 1967 British Standard, dividing the typefaces into ‘Serif’ and ‘Sans-serif’ first. Inside the Serif category, Transitional and Didone types sit aside ‘Oldstyle’ (or ‘Humanist’) serifs, a combination of Venetians and Garaldes. The sans-serif category is divided primarily into the British Standard set of Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist, but language is a living thing and the categories are always changing.</p>
<p>The advantage of this system is in historicity. It’s a convenient shorthand tracing the development of movable latin type from the 15th century to the mid-20th century. On top of that, because it’s used informally as much as it is formally, its categories are fluid and visceral — the divisions are made where people think there is a meaningful visual distinction.</p>
<p>What doesn’t change across all its permutations, is that it’s essentially a set of boxes; whenever a new visual idea is created, we need a new box. And each box needs a ‘poster-child’ to explain what is meant. Say it’s Garamond for Oldstyle, Times or Baskerville for Transitional, and Helvetica for Neo-grotesque. Everyone using the system is forced to consider shape not just through period or idea, but a specific instance because there is no abstract representation provided by these models — there <em>has</em> to be at least one example to make sense of the system. For that reason I would call the Vox-AtypI and its derivatives ‘retrospective’ taxonomies. They are good for type revivals, but they create a strong connection between the form and what is often a singular execution of a (much broader) model,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/e0563b21ef9e4bc60c88c726958abde4/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=48566">Dyson, M. C. (2011). Do designers show categorical perception of typefaces? <em>Visible Language</em>, <em>45</em>(3), 193.</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> effectively exacerbating some identifiable features over time (such as the melting ‹a› and ‹R› of Helvetica). A set of representative models encounters a less significant version of the same issue; instead a set of biases is created instead of a singular one. Critically, these problems arise regardless of how loosely the classification is used, and of how ‘rule-breaking’ the attitude of a person is towards classifying type, and whether or not they are aiming for a category when designing type.</p>
<p>In contrast, the model of The Stroke is parametric, what I would call an ‘analytical taxonomy’. On the most basic level, it distinguishes between two categories; contrast and construction, and names two categories in each of the two; the contrast is divided into <em>Translation</em> and <em>Expansion</em>, and the construction is divided into <em>Running</em> and <em>Interrupted</em>. While only having four categories might seem overly limiting, the critical component is that the contrast types present two extremes that can be interpolated between, and amount of contrast are variable.</p>
<figure><img src="Assets/media/image1.jpeg" style="width:4.64583in;height:1.97639in"/><figcaption>Figure 1: Melting ‹R› and ‹a› in Helvetica</figcaption></figure>
<p>Where such an approach excels is in control of the parameters are in place — because the theory alludes to interpolation between models and attributes models to the writing tools (or other models that then follow the writing tools), it allows for considering shapes without a specific model, allowing for space for interpretation in the process of formalising the raw contrast model it offers.</p>
<figure><img src="Assets/media/image2.png" style="width:3.60903in;height:1.98958in"/><figcaption> Figure 2: On the left, basic representation of Gerrit Noordzij's early theory, The Stroke of the Pen. On the right, a Noordzij Cube — the parametric model. Both are drawings of Gerrit Noordzij in The Stroke.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is also clearly not a taxonomy. It's more akin to a framework of understanding contrast rather than a system of classification. And, in fact, Noordzij himself intended to avoid summoning ‘the bogy of letter classification’ (Noordzij, 2006, p. 7). The theory thus does not attempt to create categories for classification of display typefaces, and it clearly focuses on the formal writing tradition of countries that use the latin alphabet — scripts that developed through the use the pointed brush like CJKVZ (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Zhuang) and scripts that can use non-standard writing tools (like palm leaf manuscripts in the case of Devanāgarī) are not covered by it by default. However, its appeal is in its simplicity and its seemingly endless expandability; through changing the angle of the writing tool, adding other writing tools to the system, one can classify anything that originates from markings made with a tool.</p>
<p>The main difference between what I call ‘retrospective taxonomies’ and ‘analytical taxonomies’ is the former is outside-in, and the latter is inside-out. When we group typefaces by their observable features, we’re essentially grouping them by their specific outlines. In retrospective taxonomies, we create buckets based on the style, and whenever new buckets are needed, some type remains hard to classify consistently until they are created. Conversely, analytical taxonomies abstract the output into a simplified model and anything that can be abstracted into the model can be classified. When we group them by the underlying mechanism, we group together shapes by morphology much more broadly and with a variable amount of granularity. The amount of granularity can increase as we add more tools. For that reason, the ‘improved’ taxonomies I will discuss later will incorporate similar ideas.</p>
<p>When the writing tool serves as a basis, the proportions fall into place together with the contrast because the written script is referenced <em>as a model</em>. If Vox-AtypI uses printing traditions as basis for classifying, The Stroke uses writing traditions. There is no shortage of exceptions in a written script — for instance, in most <em>translation</em> serifs, the roman minuscule would be based on writing with a broad nib while the capitals would be modelled after the flat-brush,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Catich, E. M. (1968). <em>The origin of the serif: Brush writing &amp; Roman letters</em>. Catfish Press.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> which has a touch of <em>expansion</em>, and in <em>expansion</em> serifs, the pen angle will not be consistent — it will be slightly different for diagonals and completely different for the spines of the ‹s› and loop of the ‹g›. Every typeface essentially functions as a record of its own decisions, because in the end the final output of typeface design is outlines — the final touches will always break out of any given underlying system in accordance to what a typeface designer sees fit. However, the relevance of these features for the purposes of classifying is questionable. Basing categories on details invites all sorts of problems that I will discuss in the following section — together with a selection of solutions.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="how-to-break-a-taxonomy">
<h2>How to break a taxonomy </h2>
<p>In the introduction, I floated the idea that a perfect taxonomy of typefaces is impossible, and in the previous section, I mentioned that details are probably best left off from classification attempts.</p>
<p>The completeness of a taxonomy in the context of writing systems and ways of styling them is unfeasable from the start — any two typefaces that follow the same morphology could technically be interpolated between, so there isn’t even a starting point and arbitrary distinctions have to be made which will cause the system to fail more over time. The entire project of classifying type was thought to be unreasonable until the middle of the 20th century.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Kupferschmid, I. (2012, March 31). Type classifications are useful, but the common ones are not – kupferschrift. <a href="https://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/03/on-classifications/">https://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/03/on-classifications/</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span></p>
<p>I think any reasonable approach of a taxonomy requires accepting that as soon as it is in use, it will be broken. The moment any category lines are delineated, typeface designers (a people hopelessly contrarian in nature) will absolutely assemble to blur them, as they had done before, intentionally or not.</p>
<p>This type of contrarian impulse is not bad (or even evil). Arguably, it is exactly the thing that can, every now and then, spark innovative ideas in typeface design. For that reason, I can’t argue against the creation of new systems of classification and ways of thinking around typography — although it is a sisyphian task if one wants the taxonomy to function, creating new category lines which one might want to blur is an end all on its own.</p>

A supremely unclassifiable typeface, each entry in the family stranger than the last, regardless of the order in which they come.

<p>Beyond that, objectivity cannot be achieved even with parametric systems unless they measure every possible quality. The search for objectivity is a pitfall of many modern discourses fall pray to<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-10"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-10" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Butler, J. (2002). Gender Trouble: Tenth Anniversary Edition (2nd ed.). Routledge. <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203902752">https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203902752</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> and shouldn’t be taken literally; the act of measuring something is not a neutral act, it follows the assumption that something is worth measuring which is in itself a subjective social construction.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-11"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-11" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Ásta Kristjana Sveinsdóttir. (2018). Categories we live by: The construction of sex, gender, race, and other social categories. Oxford university press.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> Then, discussing taxonomies should be contextual and subjective, based on their purpose and utility. Their epistemic integrity is unimportant beyond that purpose. That quality ultimately makes all taxonomies fail in some places, which is why I’d like to argue that many taxonomies applied contextually is the only way to make sense of type without introducing artificial blind-spots.</p>
<p>For the reader interested in breaking a typographic taxonomy at home, the following approaches are easy and convenient; for an analytical taxonomy, find a parameter which it doesn’t measure and make it a pivotal aspect of the design. For a retrospective taxonomy, interpolate between categories that don’t have an in-between such that its placement is ambiguous, or create something outside of existing categories, a crazy display font perhaps.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="looking-for-alternatives">
<h2>Looking for alternatives</h2>
<p>There is a certain nobleness to attempting the impossible. There has been some development in methods of classification, with various intended uses. They range from systems that are meant as intuitive search tools to ones that claim of objectivity.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-12"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-12" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">PANOSE on the Web. (n.d.). Retrieved 2 February 2025, from <a href="https://www.w3.org/Printing/stevahn.html">https://www.w3.org/Printing/stevahn.html</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> One such system is CEDARS+, which features both categories that are precise (e.g. contrast amount) alongside slightly more ‘vibes-based’ ones (‘energy’) which can be intuited in some contexts but are difficult to measure consistently across styles.</p>
<p>To accommodate for various other features that might be searched for, the ‘+’ in CEDARS+ stands for miscellaneous features that might vary per script. This tool is deliberately and clearly made for search.</p>
<figure><img src="Assets/media/image4.png" style="width:4.64583in;height:3.74028in"/><figcaption>Figure 4: Visual representations of Contrast, Energy, Details, and Structure in CEDARS+.

<p>Another system is PANOSE, which claims to classify text typefaces objectively by measuring up to 65 different parameters, and to classify display typefaces less specifically, but enough to distinguish them from one another. It’s built into both TrueType and OpenType, in the OS/2 table, and is rarely used.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-13"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-13" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Panose: Is there a purpose for it nowadays?

<br/>
</span></span></p>
<p>The measurements are useful for finding alternatives with similar qualities, and for matching Han fonts with latin.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-14"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-14" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Most fonts do not have proper calculated values for PANOSE, so using it for search fails — it’s rarely used, so typeface designers rarely bother to calculate the proper values. That makes most fonts fail to work with the system, so few places use it despite it being integrated in OpenType and TrueType.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> Much like CEDARS+, it’s a tool for searching more so than sorting. Both are also unlikely to enter common parlance because they are quite complex.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-15"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-15" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Blackmore, S. J. (2000). The Meme Machine. OUP Oxford.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> They also tend to measure outlines or reference historical models without relying on abstractions, to their detriment. For example, by assuming Noordzij’s <em>expansion</em> as the default contrast, a relatively recent development in latin type receives preferential treatment over the writing method that</p>
<p>In <em>Type classifications are useful, but the common ones are not</em>, Indra Kupferschmid proposes a system based more closely on the ideas of The Stroke. This system is quite hard to use for search in its entirety, but thanks to its modularity, it translates well into a system of tags that allows for variable specificity.</p>

<h2> Where it becomes a design tool</h2>
<figure><img src="Assets/media/image5.jpeg" style="width:4.64583in;height:6.96389in"/><figcaption>Figure 5: Kupferschmid’s 3-layered system uses Noordzij’s ideas about contrast and models as ‘bone’, the amount of contrast and structural qualities like serifs are delegated to ‘flesh’, and ‘skin’ is a catch-all for the endless possible variations on top of that — descriptions of serifs, stroke, variations on writing tool, structure, etc. Rotis still cannot be classified but this is probably one of the better approaches devised thus far for being usable and note over-complicated. Sourced from <a href="https://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/03/on-classifications/">kupferschrift.de</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that I delineated a few taxonomies and looked through their blind-spots, I’d like to engage in some speculation as for how using these can affect the making of type.</p>
<p>The obvious first point to make is that the type that is used impacts which type is made. For example — althought some typeface designers dislike the genre of ‘Neo-grotesque’<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-16"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-16" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is based on my conversations with several prolific typeface designers working in multiple EU countries (which I opt not to name) and my own opinion.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> — almost every type foundry has at least one such offering in their catalogue. They regularly become bestsellers even if their designer doesn’t find them particularly interesting. Whether it is because they land in the category of ‘neo-grotesque’ or because they remind designers of other neo-grotesques which are used as sufficiently non-specific workhorses to justify purchasing a font.</p>
<p>More interestingly, the way in which categories are constructed introduces completely new ways of conceptualising the design of type. The distction between <em>translation serif,</em> <em>humanist serif</em>, and <em>oldstyle serif</em> creates completely different expectations for what exactly we’re referring to, even if it may be the same category. If <em>oldstyle</em> implies a certain period and punchcutters, such as Claude Garamont, Francesco Griffo, or Nicolaus Jenson, <em>humanist</em> or <em>translation</em> can imply a variety of typefaces using similar proportions (or patterns<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-17"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-17" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Blokland, F.

<br/>
</span></span>) such as Arno, Dorian, or Palatino. But while humanist implies proportions more so than period, translation adds a new layer of <em>formalisation</em>. In general, any approach that makes use of abstraction will involve some form of formalisation. How exactly that process looks is, I’d argue, a source of very meaningful albeit subtle influences.</p>

<p>Somewhere:</p>
<p>I’ve argued so far that it is a worthwhile skill to be able to avoid thinking in categories rather than parameters. This proves difficult. Categories are very convenient shorthands and have a lot of memetic power. To separate a typographic practice from such convenience, the alternative has to be simple and accessible, which makes CEDARS+ and PANOSE ineffective at the sort of use I’ve been speaking of here; as a design tool. The Noordzij Cube succeeds here, but only insofar formal typography is concerned. Ultimately, my pitch is not for a ‘better’ or a ‘wider-spanning’ system of classification. What I am trying to argue for instead is to complicate the matter even more, only with categories that make sense.</p>
<p>The presence of bias is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, our typographic conventions are built on bias. We can speculate that</p>
<p>Challenging categories is essential even if we are conditioned to read through ‘traditions’ — in the end we cannot be certain about expecting best results from tight adherence to specific traditions, because variations</p>
