<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Schools of talking about letters seem fundamentally connected to the lexicon used to describe them. The approach of KABK in teaching typography and type design, for being relatively unique, offers a good vantage point to investigate some of the ways in which the language we use affects the shapes we draw. This thesis exists to critically explore the topic of vocabulary and taxonomy within typography and typeface design, their use as teaching and design tools, and suggest the hypothesis; the only way to innovate in the field of typeface design is to innovate on the methods of describing type, and through critical consideration of the categories in which one thinks. To do this, it will examine a handful of taxonomies and tools of analysis of typeface design through the qualities of type which they choose to name and separate.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This thesis is not about taxonomy, or, what some would call type classification. Instead what I’m interested in discussing, is how the words generated by taxonomies — as well as those outside of them — impact the perception, selection, and making of type.</p>
<p>As such, when I speak of ‘taxonomy’, I’m referring to many different things that might not self-describe as such. I call any system of categories a <em>taxonomy</em>, and the placement of specific typefaces in specific categories is a <em>classification</em>. I am also using terms like <em>lexicon</em>, <em>wording</em>, <em>system of classification</em>, <em>nomenclature</em>, etc as synonyms for ‘taxonomy’ as applied in different contexts; my interest is not in the rigour related to the exact linguistic categories, but rather the linguistics themselves in relation to the visual craft. And, in similar spirit, the field of typeface design does not follow any strict rigour in its categories. When I speak of ‘typeface design’, I speak of specifically formal typeface design</p>
<p>It is no secret that typographic terminology is ill-defined.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Tracy, W. (2003). Letters of credit: A view of type design (p. 13). Fraser.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> It can feel purposefully adversarial. We all gesture to a similar semiotic mess — a web of signifiers and references that sometimes work — with diverging categories that conflate distinct ideas needlessly.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Ibid.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> What emerges as a common way of understanding type is a sort of folk taxonomy, an amalgamation of different categories representing different systems, modified and rethought through decades, growing more imprecise each time a new meaning is needed.</p>
<p>This problem is fundamentally unsolvable, or so I intend to argue. However, looking at it closely provides a good basis for what I’m trying to say. My intent is, in a way, the exact opposite to solving the issues of incomplete taxonomies; I’d like to complicate further the lexicon of typography and see what happens. My hypothesis is that the only way to innovate in the field of (text) typeface design is to innovate on the methods of describing type, and through critical consideration of the categories in which one thinks. It’s an investigation of vocabulary as a pedagogical tool in case of type, but also as a design tool in its own right. My core argument, in short, is that typeface design is a process which fundamentally happens within a context of certain traditions, so positioning a typeface in <em>a context</em> is something that happens by necessity. The way we describe typefaces implies different contexts which affect which features are perceived in relation to one another. In a way, it’s a text on the process of abstraction and <em>de-abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>The chapters that follow do not create other arguments; they serve to explain and contextualise what I mean, elaborate on the argument, and introduce examples. If my argumentative musings are successful, at the end the reader will appreciate terminology as a valuable tool for understanding typography on different levels, a skill that should be developed and extended much like any other (e.g. the ability to draw, see detail, understand technology, etc.), and a form of conditioning that, if unexamined, can creates bias that one might be unaware of, be it desirable or not.</p>

<section class="level2" id="sorting-letters">
<h2>Sorting Letters</h2>
<p>I will first explain a number of ‘taxonomies’, then look into the blind-spots they create. For the purposes of this thesis, I will focus on classifications derived from Vox-AtypI and Gerrit Noordzij’s theory of The Stroke, but I will also touch on other systems of classifying, understanding, <em>and designing</em> type; a system proposed by Indra Kupferschrift, LeMo, and CEDARS+. These will serves as examples, but my argument will not rely on them.</p>
<p>The <em>Vox-AtypI classification</em> is sometimes called ‘<em>the</em> type classification’, and is many things. The original classification splits formal latin types into 3 umbrella terms and their subcategories. The first is the Classicals, containing Venetian, Garalde, and Transitional types. Following it is Moderns, containing Didones, Mechanistic (or slab-serif), and Linéales (or sans-serif), and the last main category is Calligraphics, containing Glyphic, Script, Graphic, Blackletter, and Gaelic subcategories.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32669.html">Devroye, L. (2025). <em>Vox type classification</em>. Devroye.org. https://luc.devroye.org/fonts-32669.html</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> In the modern day the category of Linéales is rarely alluded to, instead the words for sans-serifs in use come from the 1967 British Standard (based on Vox’s classification), which divides them further into more categories with more familiar names; Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://luc.devroye.org/britishstandards.html">Devroye, L. (n.d.). British Standards for Type Classification. Retrieved 30 January 2025, from https://luc.devroye.org/britishstandards.html</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> When I speak of a ‘folk taxonomy’ of typefaces, this is what I’m referring to; most imbued in the contemporary lexicon is a combination of Vox-AtypI and the 1967 British Standard, dividing the typefaces into ‘Serif’ and ‘Sans-serif’ first. Inside the Serif category, Transitional and Didone types sit aside ‘Oldstyle’ (or ‘Humanist’) serifs, a combination of Venetians and Garaldes. The sans-serif category is divided primarily into the British Standard set of Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Geometric, and Humanist. The clear outlines of these categories are always changing, being iterated on by many foundries for their website search, in speech, in writing.</p>
<p>The model of The Stroke<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Noordzij, G. (2019). The stroke: Theory of writing (P. Enneson, Trans.). Uitgeverij de Buitenkant.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> differs by being parametric. On the most basic level, it distinguishes between two categories; contrast and construction, and names two categories in each of the two; the contrast is divided into <em>Translation</em> and <em>Expansion</em>, and the construction is divided into <em>Running</em> and <em>Interrupted</em>. While only having four categories might seem overly limiting, the critical component is that the contrast types present two extremes that can be interpolated between and the amount of contrast is variable.</p>

On the right, a Noordzij Cube — the parametric model. Both are drawings of Gerrit Noordzij from the 2018 edition of The Stroke.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In <em>Type classifications are useful, but the common ones are not</em>, Indra Kupferschmid proposes a system based in some capacity on the ideas of The Stroke, but extended into three stages; the ‘bone’ — the underlying structure or model, the ‘flesh’ — features like serifs, application of contrast, and ‘skin’, compromising the details like the specifics of the serifs. Thanks to its modularity, it translates well into a system of tags that allows for variable specificity in search, sorting, and describing type.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank E. Blokland’s LeMo was made as a tool of analysis of roman type, but is also used as a tool of type design in KABK LetterStudio. It focuses on the pattern created by humanist roman type — the fence-like system of arches and stems. Its value is in providing a framework, reasoning, and words for abstracting type into a model. The process of designing type with LeMo is essentially the reversal of that; starting with the model, and <em>de-abstracting</em> into a formal roman typeface.</p>

<p>Dr Nadine Chahine’s CEDARS+ organises typefaces by precise categories (e.g. contrast amount) alongside slightly more ‘vibes-based’ ones (‘energy’) which can be intuited in some contexts but are difficult to measure consistently across styles. To accommodate for various other features that might be searched for, the ‘+’ in CEDARS+ stands for miscellaneous features that might vary per script. This tool is deliberately and clearly made for search, not so much for depicting or classifying typefaces.</p>
<p>This collection of ideas as things that should be compared is — yes — ridiculous. There are two taxonomies, one theory of writing, one theory of structure, and one search tool. Either way I think there is a good reason to work with such convoluted references — the focus on vocabulary becomes their equaliser. What interests me in all of these is <em>what they choose to name</em>. The visual differences in typefaces — that we can see. We look at the typeface and we see. But it is up to the system to create category lines and lump typefaces together, to consider which things are together and which things are not.</p>

<p>These broadly represent the two approaches commonly taken to describe type; systems like Vox-AtypI and its derivatives represent the retrospective approach to describing type, where existing material is sorted based on tradition and appearance. The Stroke, LeMo, CEDARS+, etc, represent the analytical approach, which abstracts type into a set of parameters — based on its outwards appearance, like in CEDARS+, or on its underlying structure, like The Stroke or LeMo. Both approaches have breaking points insofar their use as taxonomies is concerned, which is what the next chapter looks into.</p>

<section class="level2" id="breaking-taxonomies">
<h2>Breaking taxonomies </h2>
<p>The entire project of classifying type was thought to be unreasonable until the middle of the 20th century when it had to, due to high volumes of new types, be done.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Kupferschmid, I. (2012, March 31). Type classifications are useful, but the common ones are not – kupferschrift. <a href="https://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/03/on-classifications/">https://kupferschrift.de/cms/2012/03/on-classifications/</a><br/>
<br/>
</span></span> This Typefaces that follow the same morphology could technically be interpolated between, so there isn’t even a starting point and arbitrary distinctions have to be made which will cause the system to fail more over time.</p>
<p>The issue of interpolation is one reason why <em>retrospective</em> systems fail. The failings of <em>analytical</em> systems have to do with the subjectivity of the parameters they choose to measure; measuring something is not a neutral act; the assumption that something is worth measuring is in itself a subjective social construction.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Ásta Kristjana Sveinsdóttir. (2018). Categories we live by: The construction of sex, gender, race, and other social categories. Oxford university press.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> No number of measurements, then, create an objective categorisation or designation. Even if we agree that typefaces are built on traditions, what we extract as the essence or key characteristics of these traditions is a constructed selection. Fundamentally, every typeface is its own record of qualities and decisions that, when judged through any given lens, is reinterpreted beyond its white and black shapes.</p>
<p>Discussing taxonomies, then, always is contextual and subjective, based on their purpose and utility. Their epistemic integrity is unimportant beyond that purpose. And their completeness is unimportant also; adopting any taxonomy ensures that it will be broken. The moment any category lines are delineated, typeface designers (a people hopelessly contrarian in nature)<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Your mileage may vary<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> will blur them, as they had done before, intentionally or not.</p>
<p>The contrarian impulse is not bad. Arguably, it is exactly the thing that can, every now and then, spark innovative ideas in typeface design. For that reason, I can’t argue against the creation of new systems of classification and ways of thinking around typography — although it is a sisyphian task if one wants the taxonomy to function, creating new category lines which one might want to blur is an end all on its own.</p>

<p>For the reader interested in breaking a typographic taxonomy at home, the following approaches are easy and convenient; for an analytical taxonomy, find a parameter which it doesn’t measure and make it a pivotal aspect of the design. For a retrospective taxonomy, interpolate between categories that don’t have an in-between such that its placement is ambiguous, or create something outside of existing categories. Creating a display font can easily fill both criteria.</p>
<p>The reason for establishing the breaking points is not to be pedantic, but rather to make it clear that the act of sorting and depicting letters is inherently interpretative.</p>

<section class="level2" id="expressing-ideas">
<h2>Expressing ideas</h2>
<p>I’d like to now engage in some speculation as for how using taxonomies and just the vocabulary of systems of understanding type can affect the making of type. But first I will point out what exactly this text is.</p>
<p>What I am writing here is a ‘thesis’. However, what writing a thesis must take between 6 months and 3 years,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This claim is from Umberto Eco’s <em>How to write a thesis</em> (p. 17, 2015 MIT Press) and I’m obsessed with how it blends a ‘hard’ claim with ‘soft’ rules. It’s an unconventional way of thinking about the subject which changes how one might approach the writing of a thesis.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> then what I have written might only be a thesis in certain contexts. If I argue that the format is decided by the word count, perhaps I’d written a short essay, or by the location in which the text lies — in which case this is a blogpost. In all cases I am talking about the same document in which I intend to express a simple idea, but by choosing to describe the first section of the document as a blurb for my blogpost rather than an abstract for my thesis, I am creating a completely different expectation for myself. So I am writing different footnotes, quoting different sources in different contexts. The simple designation of something into a certain mental bracket makes me re-consider it with different expectations. I can avoid the issue by not designating anything to any category and refusing to think about it, but contextualising a project in my existing body of knowledge <em>feels to me</em> inevitable. And it <em>is</em> irreversible, but isn’t unchanging.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea that linguistic categories shape our views of reality is not new in any way. These ideas are commonly discussed in, for example, metaphysics of identity, philosophy of linguistics, and cognitive science. In <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> Ludwig Wittgenstein insinuates that a language is trained, and is a tool which enables or hinders certain types of thought.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Wittgenstein, L. (1968). Philosophical investigations (§1–47). Basil Blackwell.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> Philosopher Michel Foucault … order of discourse, order of things, aaaaaa. There are named and studied phenomena, such as Categorical Perception,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-10"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-10" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Harnad, S. (2003). Categorical perception.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> which specifically relate to how our constructed categories (thus taxonomies) relate to our ability to discern between concepts<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-11"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-11" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">The evidence on this is tenuous; a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9803395/#abstract1">2022 review</a> argues that there is no strong evidence for Categorical Perception in speech perception. However<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> and some of these effects have been (tenuously) documented in graphic designers.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-12"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-12" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Dyson, M. C. (2011). Do designers show categorical perception of typefaces?. Visible Language, 45(3), 193.<br/>
No such studies on typeface designers specifically have been conducted to my knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span></p>
<p>In my anecdotal experience, the maxim of ‘everything is done by eye’ commonly used in the field<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-13"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-13" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Hochuli, J. (2008). <em>Detail in typography</em> (p. 15). Hyphen Press.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> is sometimes invoked as a sort of ward against this sort of discourse on our conditioning.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-14"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-14" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It could be that typeface designers think of their practice as a medium for language, but not a linguistic subject in itself.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> The line of reasoning behind it which to me is the most convincing, is that the practice requires, through the process of testing and iterating, focuses on a sort of <em>affect,</em><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-15"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-15" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">O’Sullivan, S. (2001). The aesthetics of affect: Thinking art beyond representation Angelaki, 6(3), 125–135. https://doi.org/10.1080/09697250120087987<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> a specific visual feel of words, rather than any specific categorical mapping. The decisions then are all in the servitude of a certain affect, and thus are or <em>should be</em> reliant on sight alone. However — like I discussed in <em>Breaking taxonomies</em>, what we are testing for, aiming for, and where those preferences come from is not pre-ordained — it is learned.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-16"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-16" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">The relation between conditioning and typography can be seen, for example in the human ability to achieve a similar reading speed regardless of the script they are reading and its rules — such as in the following study which compared reading speed between written English and Chinese. I am quoting a study, but it should go without saying that the variety of used writing scripts suggest that our reading ability is heavily conditioned. Tan, L. H., Spinks, J. A., Eden, G. F., Perfetti, C. A., &amp; Siok, W. T. (n.d.). Reading depends on writing, in Chinese. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0503523102<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> Even in the cases of final adjustments in a typeface, which are often divorced from any system, the qualities the designer notices and can <em>name as an issue</em> are dependent on what they know to look out for, what they are trained to see as an issue, etcetera. Then the emerging <em>continuation</em> (rather than contradiction) of ‘everything is done by eye’ is ‘but you can only see what you know’.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, we should investigate the ways in which this happens. Can something as simple as an adjective affects the output?<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-17"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-17" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Of course, the adjective represents a distinct concept. Ultimately through arguing for using wider, more interesting, sometimes more unreasonable vocabulary, I’m arguing for a depth of use of existing theory.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> I would argue that this is the main utility of taxonomies, and where they intersect with proper forms of analysis and understanding type. While the former claims to simply sort letters into groups of some sort, the latter is expressly intent on changing one’s approach to typeface design — and therefore, no doubt, their output on some level. Where they interact is in creation of categories for considering aspects of design. The former ultimately fails at its intended purpose anyway; upcycling the categories only makes sense.</p>
<p>We can first look at how differences between how similar-spanning categories are constructed introduces new ways of conceptualising the design of type. The distinction between <em>translation serif,</em> <em>humanist serif</em>, and <em>oldstyle serif</em> creates different expectations for what exactly we’re referring to, even if it captures more or less the same range of typefaces. If <em>oldstyle</em> implies a certain period of punchcutting, such as Claude Garamont, Francesco Griffo, or Nicolaus Jenson, <em>humanist</em> or <em>translation</em> can imply a variety of typefaces using similar proportions (or patterns<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-18"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-18" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Blokland, F.

<br/>
</span></span>) such as Arno, Dorian, or Palatino. Both <em>translation</em> and <em>humanist</em> require the term ‘serif’ — establishing some sort of semantic connection with similarly proportioned sans typefaces — but <em>translation</em> also doesn’t refer to a typeface as a model or skeleton, but rather a tool,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-19"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-19" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">The tool does inform the model, so the ‘model’ path it traces is still part of the idea of translation in this context.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> which adds a new layer of <em>formalisation</em> that is necessary between the model and the typeface. It’s perfectly feasible to imagine ‘humanist’ being a category containing a variety of typefaces, but <em>translation</em> is the mechanism that leads the pen to create those structures to begin with — the order in which structure and contrast happens become reversed.</p>
<figure><img src="Assets/media/image6.jpeg" style="width:4.64583in;height:3.33056in"/><figcaption>Figure 6: Six serif typefaces and two models with humanist proportions.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When working with LetterModeller — which is one framework of abstracting text proportions into a <em>skeleton</em> or <em>model</em> and translation contrast — the base models cover both venetian and garalde proportions.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-20"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-20" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Because they are more or less the same structurally, mostly differing in details. In <em>On the Origin of Patterning in Movable Type</em>, Dr. Frank E. Blokland argues that early punchcutters could better be described as type refiners rather than typeface designers, creating<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> These proportions do not map <em>exactly</em> onto every serif text typeface that uses translation contrast, but they map quite closely, as seen above.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-21"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-21" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Seeing how similar the coverage of these models is, one has to wonder if the utility of using alternative taxonomies doesn’t primarily lie in how they inform the design process. After all, the main differences these create is in layers of abstraction between model and output, and how the categories interact.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span></p>
<p>The idea of ‘you can only see what you know’ can probably be taken further; just like I can choose to perceive this thesis as a blogpost based on arbitrary conditions which I’ve delineated, I can choose to perceive any given feature of a typeface <em>selectively</em>. In essence my proposition is to take advantage of the incredible human ability to self-deceive and be deluded, and of the ability to hold many conflicting thoughts in one’s mind at the same time, to let ideas interact in ways in which they otherwise wouldn’t. The maxim then becomes ‘Everything is done by eye but you can only see what you know and <em>how</em> you know it, which you’re in control of.”</p>
<p>In the context of [formal, latin] typeface design, consider the following sentences;<br/>
Typeface design is all about consistency<br/>

I often liken the making of contours to musical counterpoint, where two distinctive lines following the same thread interact across the width of the ‘writing tool’, or in digital terms, the contrast angle.<br/>

<p>All of these sentences can be seen as true, even simultaneously. At the same time, the normal practice of typeface design can choose to exclude any of them. Drawing letters with any one of them in mind over others would produce different outcomes — obviously. If we treat the ideas of stem rhythm as a priority, we might end up with something Jensonian in the end to balance the structure of the ‹n›, ‹m›. This doesn’t interfere with any other ideas; if we add on the importance of the flow of volume, perhaps that requires some sort of stem concaveness that blends them into the serifs. At this point, if we start prioritising consistency, we have to be selective about what we’re making consistent as not to undo the concave Jensonian text we’ve just created. If we make the serifs even in length now, they will ruin the spacing. If we want to make serifs consistent between diagonals and stems, we have to eyeball the flow of curvature or come up with elaborate algorithms which either way have to be engineered to conform to our eyeballed preferences. By choosing to prioritise the flow of volume and rhythm first, we’ve engineered a process that is more intuitive and less structured (visually speaking). We can become much more cognisant of which of those ideas we choose to include or exclude if we let them interact — and if we let ourselves watch them interact. What I think is also interesting is that the act of positioning a typeface, or more broadly thinking about it as something that co-exists with other typefaces, predisposes one for thinking in one of those categories. Everything in typography is a detail, so these small distinctions are essentially identifying features.</p>
<p>Letting these vocabularies interact is something that, to some extent, happens already. New terminologies, new taxonomies, new ideas emerge all the time, and as typefaces need to be described more granularly, more granular words are used. Although cliché, the infamous Stanley Morison quote still applies;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The good type-designer therefore realizes that, for a new fount to be successful, it has to be so good that only very few recognize its novelty.</em><br/>
(Morison Stanley, <em>First principles of typography</em>; p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many processes which happen within the field of typeface design, this can happen intuitively as much as it can happen when controlled. It always comes back to the eye; if taking one approach produces outputs the designer doesn’t like, they will pick a different one. But perhaps the range of approaches overall becomes more homogenous when many decisions are made based on unchecked intuition, on visual study but not theoretical one. Perhaps the way forward for the typographic canon, is more hypotheses, and more theories; some rational, some absurd, and some completely deluded.</p>
<p>If the final output is a bézier path or a drawing or painting or stone-carving, virtually no amount of irrationality in the process can prevent the final lines and areas from being good. This can be a critique of alternative systems, but I’d rather make a more open-ended point. Our typographic canon, our ways of thinking about type, could be completely wrong and irrational, and we would be prevented from correcting them because of the nature of our craft; anything could be made to work, even completely misguided ideas can work exceptionally well.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-27"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-27" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think a good example of that is Dr Blokland’s dissertation — of course, to some extent it is speculation, because no records remain from the Jenson roman or the Eusebius type — the earliest roman font/fount. But interestingly, even recent books like Riccardo Olocco’s <em>The Jenson Roman, or the most influential type in the history of printing</em> do not mention it. This typographic canon, of everything being created by eye, is deeply ingrained — even though there is absolutely no historical evidence for that being the case for thinking about it like that. The Eusebius Type was, in essence, a foundational model — if we consider the option that it was later copied rather than reinvented, even considering later writings on type as having explanatory value for the original model is like engaging in a twisted, typographic version of the watchmaker argument — refuted by Hume in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. There is a critical assumption at its core that is fundamentally unprovable. So then, why aren’t more explanatory hypotheses employed more? Whether or not it’s projection of contemporary practice onto that of the past is outside the scope of this text.<br/>

</span></span> Therefore it’s worthwhile to be invested in a plurality of ideas. Either way they are all, probably, wrong.</p>

<h2>Thinking slow</h2>
<p>Type design is a long process — at its fastest can be a full day, at its slowest it takes about thirty years.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-28"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-28" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">To my knowledge of existing projects — I suppose anything can take about as long as it wishes to given the right circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
</span></span> With taking such a time, any discovery — that might precede its language — has the time to develop into a system of some sort. The system doesn’t need a name to be name-able and become a de facto category.</p>
<p>To end, I think it’s good to see where this whole thing came from. I find that the typographic canon seems to be stuck in modernist philosophy — which is kind of out for decades by now — and I have to wonder if that isn’t because the main way in which communication occurs in the field is through a system devised in the 1950’s and 60’s. As a student of the KABK, taught formally to recognise type through Noordzij’s ideas and several other methods, and previously a self-taught amateur type designer who knew nothing beyond the family of Vox-AtypI taxonomies, I recognise the difference this made in my own ability to perceive type and therefore design it.</p>
<p>I don’t think perception as a design tool is an innovative idea — when writing this text, I continuously felt that the point I was alluding to was rather banal. But to make use of categorical perception as a design tool is not an idea I encountered thus far in my study. It seems so simple — perhaps it’s implied? After all, there is so much recent literature in the humanities about self-deception, about the failures of categories, about the biases they create. But how exactly this process happens, what it means to <em>use</em> it happening (rather than learn to change thinking where different rules apply, to change it dynamically as a means to achieving different ends), is more important to me as a typeface designer than the anthropology of it is to me as a person. So then, maybe I didn’t write a thesis nor a blogpost nor an essay, but a PSA.</p>

<h2>Bibliography</h2>
<p>The full bibliography is in the sidenotes right now. I will generate a compiled bibliography once I know which notes make it to the final text.</p>
<p>Extras</p>
<p>Schools of thought create all these ways of thinking about shapes, and all these words to describe them, but when they don’t end up used as descriptors — in part no doubt because they are not commonly understood — the capacity of others.</p>
<p>My suggestion wouldn’t just be to come up with new words, but also to look into old ones and use them generously.</p>
<p>All of these sentences could be used to describe the practice of making formal type. And it’s no surprise that making it with any one of them in mind over others would produce somewhat different outcomes. What I think is interesting is that the act of positioning one’s typeface, or more broadly thinking about it as something that co-exists with other typefaces, predisposes one for thinking in one of those categories. Of course, these finial ‘models of modelling paths’ are influenced by many more things than just categorical perception. l</p>
<p>It’s unbelievable the amount of categories we have created in typeface design. For instance, the separation of serifs from a sort of ‘core’ structure of letters.</p>
<p>Trash bin</p>
<p>At this point it becomes relevant if my attempts to tie understanding of concepts into specific words are rational. All the distinctions I’m pointing to are not just in words but in concepts — and whether or not a distinction can be made is an open ended question. However the reason why I specifically advocate for using specific terminologies rather than ways of thinking is because</p>
<p>Herein lies the central idea of this thesis. This idea is not at all revolutionary, but it is — in my opinion and to my understanding — deeply underutilised in the context of typeface design, and graphic design as a whole. These categories that are delineated seem very deeply tied to the schools of thought.</p>
<p>Just because typeface designers might have a more granular idea of type, doesn’t mean they are immune to the effects of these similar but ultimately different category lines. In just the nuances of how one can formalise a model, there is an endless supply of ideas that are more likely to appear depending on the model used to think about the process; formalising a purely geometric model is completely unlike formalising a calligraphic approximation. In a way, this idea is the crux of my argument; depending on how we abstract ideas — using an example signifier, into some kind of modular model — is not a process that happens only in analysis. When held in mind while designing, the same happens in reverse; the abstractions have to be formalised into an output that is ultimately outlines.</p>
